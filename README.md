## Description
*ComposerSymlinkLocal* helps you to developer composer's packages 
on your local machine. Developing composer's packages locally
is sometimes problematic. Pushing to repo and waiting for changes on
packagist and updating packages needs a lot of time. *ComposerSymlinkLocal*
comes to help you with that.

*ComposerSymlinkLocal* bases on your filesystem's symlinks.
In your vendor's project creates an symlink to your directory
where local files of packages are stored. Changes when you do
in your package are immediately visible in vendor. 
Symlinks are one of many ways to develop composer's packages quickly.
